  "mission": "software-dev",
  "source_description": "Add a file export recoding feature. Like view but it will recode the files in the specified format. Create a list of format definitions, like mp3-320, aiff, flac, flac-pioneer (16 bit, 2 channels no multichannel, 44.1 kHz - full Pioneer compatible). Format can be specified on encoding. Make sure all metatags and cover are transferred. Use ffmpeg as the backend. If no cover art is embedded and a cover file exists, embed the file. Files already in the correct format can be copied. Add incremental skip-existing support. Also add aiff-pioneer and wav-pioneer for downscaling to 16-bit 44.1kHz stereo.",
